This repository contains a series of files I have written that, together, enable a user to:

1. Perform SQL to combine data from two separate tables
2. Apply foreign key constraints to the schema
3. Apple general constraints to the schema
4. Test all constraints with unit tests
5. Create views, and query views
6. Create a simple index on the schema
